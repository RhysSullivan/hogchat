Concept:
Talk to your PostHog data, the user provides their PostHog API key 
and then they can ask questions about their data.

Question examples:

- How many users signed up last week?
- What is the average number of events per user?
- What were the top 10 pages visited last month?


functions:
- list suggestions
- get data





HogQL Rules:

If an event or property name has a space, it should be wrapped in quotes.

To filter to a specific event, use FROM events WHERE event = '{event_name}'

To filter to a specific property, use WHERE properties.{property_name} = {value}

To get events older than 5 days, use the expression:

dateDiff('day', timestamp, now()) > 5

Don't end queries with a semicolon.
